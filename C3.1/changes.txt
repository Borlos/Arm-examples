Important differences between this and the book:

*added all unused handlers in ts.s, redirect to C functions in "exceptions.c"
*added "exceptions.c" to manage all other exceptions with infinite loops
*added VIC Base and referenced Adresses in "defines.h"
*added a *memcpy function in string.c, is the last function
*added a clear of timer chars in "timer.c" before writing others over them, inside the timer_handler.
